    <h1 class="cat-body">This work is made in illustrator. It is based of a picture of our cat Mandarin. He is called that both because he is orange like a mandarin orange, and also because we suspect he is fluent in mandarin chinese but refuses to speak it. I will get back on this matter, as it is (at the moment) irrelevant to this assignment. Peace out.</h1>
